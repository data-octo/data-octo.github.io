[GAN Introduction from Google TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.13/tensorflow/contrib/eager/python/examples/generative_examples/dcgan.ipynb)

GANs, or Generative Adversarial Networks, are a framework for estimating generative models. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process: a Generator, which is responsible for generating data (say, images), and a Discriminator, which is responsible for estimating the probability that an image was drawn from the training data (the image is real), or was produced by the Generator (the image is fake). During training, the Generator becomes progressively better at generating images, until the Discriminator is no longer able to distinguish real images from fake.
