# Chapter 2 — Freshman Year at the Faculty of Science: Exploring Resources (Winter 2026–2027)

## Academic Challenges and Emotional Growth

Winter term brings snow to Vancouver and a sharper academic pace. The five face different challenges while learning to use UBC’s rich resources; their emotional ties deepen.

Wang Xiaojie struggles in Physics 101: Canadian teaching emphasizes experiments and critical thinking, contrasted with his previous rote learning. Agentic AI lab assistants require different approaches.

Chen Siyu comforts him, recommending the Learning Commons and neural-feedback stress-management tools. Their close support deepens their emotional connection.

Li Mingxuan focuses on entrepreneurship resources, while Zhang Haoran supports Liu Xiaomei through calculus concerns, encouraging her organizational strengths.

## Using Learning Resources More Deeply

They visit Irving K. Barber Learning Centre and get personalized, neuroscience-driven study strategies.

AI learning advisor recommendations include active learning, optimized time management, Cornell note-taking with AI, use of office hours, and emotional regulation via neural feedback.

Li asks about entrepreneurship support; the advisor points to Sauder courses and entrepreneurship@UBC, with agentic AI mentors available.

They learn they work particularly well together: the group’s discussion quality is significantly higher than average, per AI analysis.

## Government and Practical Supports

International students Xiaojie and Xiaomei learn about Canadian policies: work permits, study and work hours, health coverage (MSP with digital health records), tax filing with AI assistance, and scholarships matched by AI.

They realize practical pathways: PGWP (post-graduation work permit), digital health services, and AI-driven career matching.

## Friendships, Clubs, and Early Romance

They get involved in clubs: AI/quantum computing labs, programming club, entrepreneurship groups, volunteer work, and sports. Social AI helps match them with suitable organizations.

At a winter music festival, Xiaojie and Siyu share a dance—an intimate moment—while Haoran and Xiaomei grow closer through event coordination.

## Mental Health, Support Groups, and Growth

Pressure builds toward midterms; Liu Xiaomei struggles with anxiety. Her friends encourage her to use counseling services that combine AI diagnostics and neural-feedback therapy. They form an emotional support circle; AI metrics show improved well-being.

By the end of the term they’ve grown academically and emotionally: higher GPAs for some, practical experience for others, and confirmed relationships and career directions.
