# Chapter 3 — Transferring into Computer Science: Building Networks (2027)

## Major Transfer Challenges and Emotional Tests

In spring 2027 the group prepares to apply to UBC’s competitive Computer Science program. Transfer acceptance is tougher than ever; new AI skills assessments are part of the process.

Requirements are stringent: relevant CS courses, strong GPA, coding competitions, research or project experience, and AI-assisted skill evaluations. Competition has increased substantially.

Wang feels the pressure most: maintaining grades while balancing practical interviews and AI coding assessments. Siyu, now his partner, supports him emotionally and academically.

## AI-era Transfer Strategy

They create a plan with academic preparation (CPSC courses), AI skill development (neural networks, quantum computing), networking (student societies, mentors), and application materials (statements, recommendation letters, project portfolios).

They use agentic AI tools to manage study schedules, prepare for coding exams, and find research opportunities. Emotional support sessions help manage stress.

## Deepening Community Involvement

Li organizes participation in AI hackathons, VR coding collaboratives, and industry talks. The team contributes to open-source projects and attends AI ethics seminars. Haoran coordinates ethics workshops; Xiaomei provides logistical support and grows in confidence.

Internships and co-op placements increase their experience: Xiaojie interns at a local AI healthcare startup; Li interns at an AI venture fund; Haoran works as a course assistant; Xiaomei gains project coordination roles.

## Professors, Mentors, and Alumni

They carefully cultivate faculty relationships, apply for undergraduate research, and leverage alumni advice. AI systems match them with suitable professors and opportunities.

## Transfer Decisions and Outcomes

By May results arrive: Li, Wang, and Haoran are accepted into the CS program based on GPA, projects, AI assessments, and faculty recommendations. Their friendships and romantic relationships strengthen as they celebrate the milestone.
