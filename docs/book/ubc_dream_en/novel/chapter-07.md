# Chapter 7 — An Unexpected Turn: Life Choices

## Academic Crisis

In senior fall, Liu Xiaomei fails the advanced algorithms exam twice and risks delayed graduation. She is distraught despite hard work.

## Rethinking Career Paths

Career counseling suggests her strengths lie in organization, management, and interpersonal skills rather than algorithm design. She explores product management, data analysis, technical support, and project management.

## New Opportunities and Family Conversations

After honest talks with family and mentors, Xiaomei considers a management trainee role at a retail chain—practical experience that leverages her strengths and offers stability and growth.

## Blending Tech and Management

At work she learns operations, supply chain, and digital transformation projects. She eventually integrates technical ideas (inventory systems, analytics) with management skills and finds satisfaction.

## Reimagining Success

Xiaomei’s story shows success is not one-size-fits-all. She gains confidence, helps others, and becomes a bridge between technical teams and business needs.
