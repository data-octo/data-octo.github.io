# Chapter 9 — Friendship and Love: The Emotional World

## Feelings Take Root

In the spring before graduation the group experiences subtle changes in relationships. With Sakura blooming at UBC, emotions intensify amid uncertainty.

Wang Xiaojie worries about long distance when Chen Siyu begins a PhD in Toronto. They discuss communication, trust, and how to maintain the relationship.

## Deepening Bonds

The friends form a strong support system: academic help, career advice, emotional counsel, and practical care during illness and stress. Shared memories—first gatherings, trips, celebrations—bind them.

## Xiaojie & Siyu: A Long-Distance Commitment

They commit to trying a long-distance relationship with daily calls, virtual dates, monthly visits, shared plans, and mutual support for career goals.

## Others’ Emotional Journeys

Li Mingxuan contemplates companionship beyond career. Zhang Haoran and Liu Xiaomei explore a growing mutual fondness. Cultural backgrounds shape expectations but they find ways to balance family traditions with modern values.

## Maintaining Friendship

They keep the core five-person circle active—monthly gatherings, inclusive events, and joint trips—so friendships remain central even as romantic relationships evolve.
